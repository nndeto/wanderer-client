# Wanderer

## User Stories
### Who is the user?
Our user is the budding or seasoned traveller who revels in exploring new places and cultures and wants to share it with the ever-growing travel community. 

### Existing Features
* Visual-first landing page with multiple React components rendered over a parallax simulated background
* Easy to navigate navbar that takes the user betweeen the home and about page
* An all cities grid-implemented visual navigation, at the end of the landing page, that takes users to previously travelled cities
* A city show page with:
    * a picture of the city
    * form to add a post 
    * ability to view added posts for the city they've been created in
    * ability to edit or delete old posts
    * ability to click the post title and be taken to a post show page
* A post show page that allows the user to view the post title and content

## Planned Features
If we continued to work on our project, we'd like to create solutions for the features listed below:
* User Signup/Login
* Adding Comments to Posts
* Editing/Deleting Comments
* Visual Map with markers of where the community has been
* Form Validators

## Triumphs
Being able to scroll through compnents on the landing page was a challenge that we were able to transform into a win, once we were able to implement it into our project. Being able to come together as a team the night before the project was due and bring a collective vision to life after a week of struggling, helped make the final product something we could be proud of. 


## Challenges
Being able to execute all our user experience goals within the time frame turned out to be a challenge due to learning the new React material and understanding how to best utilize it. It was also a challenge to figure out how to get all the components to render on the landing page to create a seamless user scroll experience. Lastly, since our app is a mostly visual experience, curating high quality photos that kept to the theme of the website proved to be more time-consuming than initially thought.
